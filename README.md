CRET: Chemically Reasonable Tethering
CRET (Chemically Reasonable Tethering) is a unified computational framework for fragment linking in drug discovery. It automates the generation of chemically plausible linkers between molecular fragments, directly within a 3D binding pocket, while maintaining synthetic accessibility and fragment geometry.

The source code will be made publicly available upon formal publication of the associated manuscript.

A preprint describing the method is available here:
